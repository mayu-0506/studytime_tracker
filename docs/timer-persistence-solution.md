# Timer Persistence Solution

## Problem
The study timer was stopping when users navigated away from the `/study` page because the timer component would unmount, causing the interval to be cleared.

## Solution Implemented
We implemented a global timer context that persists across all page navigations by:

1. **Created TimerContext** (`/contexts/TimerContext.tsx`)
   - Wraps the `useStudyTimer` hook in a React Context
   - Provides timer state and controls globally

2. **Updated Root Layout** (`/app/layout.tsx`)
   - Added `TimerProvider` to wrap the entire application
   - Timer now lives at the root level and persists across all pages

3. **Created Persistent UI Components**:
   - **HeaderTimerIndicator** (`/components/HeaderTimerIndicator.tsx`): Shows timer status in the header
   - **PersistentTimerDisplay** (`/components/PersistentTimerDisplay.tsx`): Floating timer widget on non-study pages

4. **Updated Study Page** (`/app/(main)/study/page.tsx`)
   - Changed from `useStudyTimer()` to `useTimer()` context
   - Timer state is now shared globally

## Features
- Timer continues running when navigating between pages
- Visual indicators in header show current timer status
- Floating timer widget on all pages (except study page)
- Can pause/resume/stop timer from any page
- localStorage backup still works for browser refresh/close

## Testing
Visit `/test-timer-persistence` to verify the timer continues working across page navigations.

## Technical Details
- The timer interval runs in the global context, not tied to any specific component
- State is managed at the root level, preventing unmount issues
- localStorage still provides backup for page refreshes
- Visual indicators update in real-time across all pages
